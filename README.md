# developer-portfolio

This is my simple developer portfolio. It has my contact information and shows my abilities through my projects and links to Github.

ISSUES:
1. Change Hero Image
2. Change Hero Text
3. Change Portfolio projects section
  3a. Add some kind of description to portfolio projects
  3b. Click to demo (maybe in section title)
  3c. Add "See More Projects" section
4. Edit Services section (languages, abilities)
5. Edit Expertise to company culture fit
6. Remove Process
7. Edit contact section
8. Edit FAQs
9. Narrow spacing on Footer probably
